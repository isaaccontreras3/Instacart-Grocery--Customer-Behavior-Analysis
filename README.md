# Instacart Grocery: Customer Behavior Analysis
## Project Summary
This repository offers an exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data to uncover customer purchasing patterns. By collaborating with sales and marketing teams, I translate their questions into data analysis—identifying peak ordering times, spending habits, and product popularity—to provide actionable insights. The project also examines customer segmentation across various demographics to inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance campaign effectiveness.

## Key Questions
• What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?

• At what times do customers spend the most money?

• With Instacart’s wide range of product prices, what recommendations can simplify price range groupings to better guide marketing efforts?

• Are there specific types of products that are more popular than others?

• How is brand loyalty distributed among users?

• Do ordering habits vary based on a customer’s loyalty status?

• Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

• Is there a connection between age and family status regarding ordering habits?

• What classifications can be derived from demographic information, such as age, income, types of goods, and family status?

• How do ordering habits differ among various customer profiles?
